# ArduBrain
ArduBrain is an application for the arduboy that trains your brain and tracks the enhancements using minigames and tests.

# Tests

## Reflex
Press the A button as soon as the screen change color: the faster the reflex, the higher the score.
The screen has the dpad (up-down-left-right) and buttons (A,B) on screen. Now and then one of the 6 onscreen buttons changes color and the player needs to click the button that matches the onscreen one as soon as possible and before the onscreen button reverts to its previous color.
There is an image in the screen, then another comes and the user should press A if it matches the previous, or B if it's new. As fast as possible.

## Planning
Classic game with a 4x4 grid containing 15 numbers and a hole. The player has to sort the numbers.

## Cognitive
Predict where a ball will hit. It could be a game about positioning a bucket to where a ball will fall. Higher difficulties could add pegs that bounce the ball.

## Auditory
The arduboy generates a random sequence of notes and plays it. The player is then showed a grid of notes where it need to recreate the sequence. The fewer attempts, the higher the score.

## Focus
Breathing exercise where the user should follow his breath and press A while inhaling and releasing while exhaling.
The app can guide the user with how long to inhale and how long to exhale for relaxation.

## Memory

### Numeric Memory
The application teaches how to convert numbers into consonants, how to find words that contain those consonants and how to use the method of loci to memorize those words.
A test will allow the player to read a sequence of numbers for some time (10 seconds per digit?), then ask to repeat it again.

### Visual Memory
Test where some figures are shown for some time, then the player is shown a different set of figures and needs to identify which ones are new, or which ones are from the previous set.
There is a grid of whithe squares. Some turn black for some seconds, then white again. The player needs to remember which ones changed.

### Verbal Memory
A word appears on the screen and the player needs to click A if it's new or B if it appeared before. Then more words appear.

### Spatial Memory
A small maze (town?) is shown on screen completely, then the game start. The player needs to go from one point to another. The twist is that the field of view of the player is only 5x5 or 3x3 or 1x1: evey other cell of the town is hidden.
